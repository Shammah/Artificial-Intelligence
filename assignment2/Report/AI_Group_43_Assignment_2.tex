\textbf{intro} 

\section{Classifiers}
discuss two algo's : knn and decision trees. do not dicuss results in this section but in section "Results".
\subsection{K-nearest neighbour}
talk about knn implementation.
\subsection{Decision trees}
discuss decision trees and extensions + algo's + possible dependencies between extensions
\subsubsection{Entropy + information}
just say we implemented entropy and state 0log0 = 0
\subsubsection{Decision trees for discrete variables}
implementation first decision tree with discrete variables.
\subsubsection{Pruning}
implementation of pruning
\subsubsection{Decision trees for continuous variables}
discuss "granularity of data". Especially mention the way we determine the value on which to split.
\subsubsection{Building a random forest}
Mention that we divided our dataset in a round robin fashion and discuss how we build the trees.
\subsubsection{Additional features}
Mention additional features we came up with.

\section{Results}
Have fancy tables and pictures (graphs?) and compare the results. Especially error rate. 

\section{Contributions}
blabla

\section{Manual}
depends on how we are going to present the results. Maybe GUI for easy use, maybe command line or something for easy programming :)
